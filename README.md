## A kawa-mode for Emacs.

This package provides a semi-usable, unfinished Kawa mode for Emacs.

Works 100% of the time when it works.

The REPL is started in scheme mode, as the syntax highlighting in the code windows.

This is mostly an exercise to understand how REPL works in various modes in Emacs, but can be used to some extent too.
